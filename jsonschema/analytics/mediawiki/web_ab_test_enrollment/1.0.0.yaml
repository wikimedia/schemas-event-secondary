      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:

  web_pageview_id:
    description: >
      Identifies a single web page view (visit). This identifier is randomly
      generated the first time it is requested by the instrumentation code on
      any page view and persists for the lifetime of the page. When the user
      navigates to another page or refreshes/reloads the page, this identifier
      disappears and a new one is regenerated (when needed). Different visits to
      the same page will yield different pageview IDs (also called tokens).

      Interactions with multiple features (instrumented separately) on the same
      web page may be linked together via this identifier.

      Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.getPageviewToken()

  web_session_id:
    description: >
      Identifies a web session: a cluster of actions taken by the user on a
      website within a limited period of time. A session ID is generated the
      first time it is requested by the instrumentation code, which is usually
      the first time the user visits the website.

      In the current implementation, this ID is shared across windows, tabs, and
      page views in the same browser. The ID is normally regenerated after the
      browser is shut down; however, if the browser's "restore previous session"
      feature is used when it restarts, the previous ID is retained.

      Interactions across multiple pages in the same web session may be linked
      together via this identifier.

      Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.sessionId()
