      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:

      Standard identifiers for Wikimedia product/feature analytics on

      NOTE: Unlike the fields in the related app_identifiers fragment -- which
      are
            filled in automatically by the Event Platform Client libraries for
            Android and iOS -- these fields are (currently) *not* automatically set
            by EventLogging's `mw.eventLog.submit()` and must be set by
            instrumentation code when it is putting together the event data.

          What the user caused or did:

          * ime-change: User changed the used input method. Switching input
          method on and off via Ctrl-M is also considered a change from/to
          'system' input method. The ime id is stored in the inputMethod field.

          * ime-disable: User completely disabled input method functionality via
          ULS settings.

          * ime-enable: User completely enabled input method functionality via
          ULS settings.

          * language-change: User changes a language for something. The
          something is defined in the context field. Also the
          languageSelectionMethod field is filled.

          * font-change: User changes a font. Both contentFont and interfaceFont
          fields are populated. Those can be mapped to languages by inspecting
          the interfaceLanguage and contentLanguage fields.

          * no-search-result: User searched for a language with no results. The
          search string is stored in the context field. The page title is stored
          in the title field. The ulsPurpose is stored in the ulsPurpose field
          to understand what was the purpose of the language search:
          interlanguage links, IME, etc.

          * login-click: Anonymous user clicked login link in ULS when
          configured in a way that anons cannot change language.

          * settings-open: User opened ULS settings. The location where they
          were opened is stored in the context field.

          * ui-lang-revert: User reverted the interface language change via
          tooltip.

          * more-languages-access: Used accessed "..." to get more languages for
          something. The something is defined in the context field.

          * webfonts-enable: User enabled the webfonts functionality via ULS
          settings.

          * webfonts-disable: User completely disabled the webfonts
          functionality via ULS settings.

          * compact-language-links-open: User opens the compact language links
          treatment. The context field defines which trigger was used to open
          the treatment.

          Identifies a single web page view (visit). This identifier is randomly
          generated the first time it is requested by the instrumentation code
          on any page view and persists for the lifetime of the page. When the
          user navigates to another page or refreshes/reloads the page, this
          identifier disappears and a new one is regenerated (when needed).
          Different visits to the same page will yield different pageview IDs
          (also called tokens).

          Interactions with multiple features (instrumented separately) on the
          same web page may be linked together via this identifier.

          Instrumentation code should assign this with
          mw.user.getPageviewToken()

          Identifies a web session: a cluster of actions taken by the user on a

          first time it is requested by the instrumentation code, which is
          usually the first time the user visits the website.

          In the current implementation, this ID is shared across windows, tabs,
          and page views in the same browser. The ID is normally regenerated
          after the browser is shut down; however, if the browser's "restore
          previous session" feature is used when it restarts, the previous ID is
          retained.

          Interactions across multiple pages in the same web session may be
          linked together via this identifier.

          Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.sessionId()
