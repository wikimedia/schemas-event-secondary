    total_length:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Total length of time (in milliseconds) from the
        `visibility_listeners_time` to the point at which the page is unloaded.

        Note that this time may include time that the user has the page hidden.
        If interested in the page's total visible time, see the `visible_length`
        field.
    dom_interactive_time:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Total length of time (in milliseconds) till DOM interactive event which
        is the point at which the browser has finished parsing the HTML and DOM
        construction is complete [1]. Note that the user may or may not be able
        to see any pixels on the screen at this point in time.
        
        Note that this will only be present for UAs that support the
        `PerformanceNavigationTiming` API [2].

    first_paint_time:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Total length of time (in milliseconds) till first paint which is the
        point at which the first pixels get displayed to the user. Note that
        although at least part of the page is visible to the user at this point
        in time, the user may or may not be able to see the entire page.

        Note that this will only be present for UAs that support the
        `PerformancePaintTiming` API [1].

    visibility_listeners_time:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Total length of time (in milliseconds) till visibility event listeners
        were added to the document which enable the tracking of the page's
        visibility as defined by the `visibilitychange` event [1][2]. This point
        in time is also used as the starting point in the calculation of the
        `total_length` and `visible_length` fields.

        `visibility_listeners_time` to the point at which the page was unloaded
        excluding the total time that the document was "hidden" as defined by
        the Page Visibility API [1].
