  The schema defines:

  1. The standard contextual attributes that can be recorded when a user
     performs an instrumented interaction with a MediaWiki instance; and

  2. The standard shape of the events that model those instrumented
     interactions.

  These attributes convey information about the who, what, when, and where of
  the instrumented interaction. They are sent alongside a databag of custom
  data, which is provided by the instrument. The databag of custom data
  conveys information about the how of the instrumented interaction.

  The attributes are collected by many instruments in many products and are
  are used in many kinds of analysis. To ensure these attributes are being
  implemented faithfully, the Metrics Platform is responsible for assigning
  values to them.

  See https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Metrics_Platform for more detail.

          also used by event stream configuration subscribers to identify
          which events they would like to appear in the stream.
