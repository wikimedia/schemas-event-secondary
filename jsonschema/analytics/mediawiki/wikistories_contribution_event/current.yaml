            The type of event that occured:

            * story_builder_open: The user opens the story editing interface.

            * add_frame: The user adds a new frame to the story. Currently, this happens when the
            user adds an image to the story, which becomes a new frame. Multiple images can be added
            at once, but this should only result in a single event.

            * remove_frame: The user deletes a frame from the story.

            * replace_image: The user replaces an image already used in the story.

            * import_text: The user imports text from an article into a frame.

            * edit_text: The user edits the text in a frame. Logged when the user leaves a text box
            having made/saved a change.

            * publish_failure: The user's publish attempt fails due to an invalid title, AbuseFilter
            or other publication limit.

            * publish_success: The user's publish attempt succeeds and the story is published.
