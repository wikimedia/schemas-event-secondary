      Identifies an install of the app and persists across all sessions. When
      the user uninstalls the app and re-installs it, a new app install ID is
      randomly generated.

      the Wikipedia app for Android and iOS.

  app_session_id:
    description: >
      Identifies an app session: a cluster of actions taken by the user in the
      app within a limited period of time. A session ID is generated the first
      time it is requested by the instrumentation code, which will usually be
      soon after the user launches the app. A new session ID is generated
      anytime the app has been inactive (that is, in the background state) for
      at least 15 minutes or has been forcibly stopped by the OS or the user.

      This identifier is managed and assigned automatically by the EPC library
      in the Wikipedia app for Android and iOS.

      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:

      In cases where user has selected multiple notifications and has marked all
      as read (and archived), a unique identifier is generated for the set and
      included with the event sent for each of the notifications. This enables
      us to analyze usage of the multi-select feature
