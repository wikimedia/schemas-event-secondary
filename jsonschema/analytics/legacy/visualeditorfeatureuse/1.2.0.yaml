  Basic data on the use of various tools and feature provided by the
  VisualEditor. You can join it with Schema:EditAttemptStep data to enrich with
  user- and session-level data; as of May 2020, some of this is duplicated into
  this schema as well. For living dictionary of current values, see

  client_dt:
    description: >
      ISO-8601 formatted timestamp of when the event occurred/was generated in
      UTC). This exists separately from meta.dt in the main common schema. For
      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:

          For example, 'dialog-open' or 'annotation-toggle-selection'. This is
          not an enum so that the visual editor's maintainers have flexibility
          in which of its many features to implement and because extensions can
          add arbitrary new features which could pass through
          already-instrumented code paths.

          '2019-03-mobile-VE-section-editing-control'. If multiple buckets need
          to be set at once (e.g. for overlapping experiment), separate the

          that the visual editor's maintainers have flexibility in which of its
