  Basic data on the use of various tools and feature provided by the
  VisualEditor. You can join it with Schema:EditAttemptStep data to enrich with
  user- and session-level data; as of May 2020, some of this is duplicated into
  this schema as well. For living dictionary of current values, see

              The user-facing capability that is being used, such as 'link',
              'autosave', 'clipboard' or 'textStyle/bold'. This is not an enum
              so that the visual editor's maintainers have flexibility in which
              of its many features to implement and because extensions can add
              arbitrary new features which could pass through
              already-instrumented code paths.

          action:
            description: >-
              The specific, technical action that has been trigged, written as a
              hyphen-separated phrase consisting of the object and the action
              taken. For example, 'dialog-open' or
              'annotation-toggle-selection'. This is not an enum so that the
              visual editor's maintainers have flexibility in which of its many
