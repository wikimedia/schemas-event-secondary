description: >
  Tracks events related to use of Extension:ContentTranslation, which is
  maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation's Language Engineering team. Some
  tracked events are user-initiated (like opening the dashboard and starting a
  new translation), while others are system-intitiated (like warning the user
  about using too much unmodified machine translation).

  For further details, see the readme in the schema repository.

      `blank` and `source` are not real translation engines; `blank` means the
      user is starting with a blank segment and `source` means the user is
      starting with the untranslated source text.

      `dashboard_delete_translation`).
    type: string
  translation_source_title:

  translation_target_title:
    description: >
      The title of the page in which the current translation has been or will be

      `lead_section` means a translation of the first section of an article,

  user_global_edit_count:
    description: >
      The user’s edit count across all Wikimedia wikis, available from
      CentralAuth. Not applicable to anonymous users.

      In the context of Content Translation, the global edit count is much more
      useful than a single local edit count, since the user will have different
      edit counts at the source and target wikis.

      information that could be used to reidentify the user. Not applicable to
      anonymous users.

      The values are the ones returned by EventLogging's

  utm_campaign:

      The value of the URL's `utm_campaign` query parameter, used to identify
      the campaign responsible for the traffic (e.g. Wikipedia Asian Month

      GapFinder or Facebook).
    type: string
  web_pageview_id:
    description: >
      Identifies a single web page view (visit). This identifier is randomly
      generated the first time it is requested by the instrumentation code on
      any page view and persists for the lifetime of the page. When the user
      navigates to another page or refreshes/reloads the page, this identifier
      disappears and a new one is regenerated (when needed). Different visits to
      the same page will yield different pageview IDs (also called tokens).

      Interactions with multiple features (instrumented separately) on the same
      web page may be linked together via this identifier.

      Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.getPageviewToken()
    type: string
    maxLength: 20
    minLength: 20
    pattern: '^[0-9a-z]{20}$'
  web_session_id:
    description: >
      Identifies a web session: a cluster of actions taken by the user on a
      website within a limited period of time. A session ID is generated the
      first time it is requested by the instrumentation code, which is usually
      the first time the user visits the website.

      In the current implementation, this ID is shared across windows, tabs, and
      page views in the same browser. The ID is normally regenerated after the
      browser is shut down; however, if the browser's "restore previous session"
      feature is used when it restarts, the previous ID is retained.

      Interactions across multiple pages in the same web session may be linked
      together via this identifier.

      Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.sessionId()
    type: string
    maxLength: 20
    minLength: 20
    pattern: '^[0-9a-z]{20}$'
  wiki_db:
    description: >
      The database code for the wiki which the user is currently interacting
      with (and which is shown in the current URL). This is less meaningful than
      usual because Content Translation presents a single, cross-wiki interface
      to the user.
