          Identifies the context in which the event was created. Every time a
          new search is performed a searchEngineResultPage event is created.
          When the user clicks a link in the results a visitPage event is
          created. When the user has dwelled for N seconds (see 'checkin' below)
          a checkin event occurs. If the user clicks an interwiki result
          provided by TextCat language detection, there is a iwclick event. If
          the user clicks on a sister search result from the sidebar, that's an
          ssclick. If the user interacts with a result to explore similar
          (pages, categories, translations), there are hover-on, hover-off, and
          esclick events. If the user performs a virtual page view via the
          popups extension a virtualPageView is recorded.
