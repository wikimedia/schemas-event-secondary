              Identifies the context in which the event was created. Every time a
              new search is performed a searchEngineResultPage event is created.
              When the user clicks a link in the results a visitPage event is
              created. When the user has dwelled for N seconds (see 'checkin' below)
              a checkin event occurs. If the user clicks an interwiki result
              provided by TextCat language detection, there is a iwclick event. If
              the user clicks on a sister search result from the sidebar, that's an
              ssclick. If the user interacts with a result to explore similar
              (pages, categories, translations), there are hover-on, hover-off, and
              esclick events. If the user performs a virtual page view via the popups
              extension a virtualPageView is recorded.

              A unique identifier generated per search session. A search session
              identifies a single user performing searches within a limited
              timespan. If no search is performed within ten minutes of a previous
              search a new session id is generated.

            type: string
            description: >-
              A unique identifier generated per visited page. This allows a
              visitPage and checkin events to be directly correlated.

              The number of milliseconds it took between requesting results and
              showing them to the user in a searchResultPage event. This is always
              reported for autocomplete events and is only reported on browsers
              supporting the navigation timing api for full text.

              multiple times. This happens in particular with IE where we emulate

            description: >-
              A way to flag events that came from a user who entered themselves into
