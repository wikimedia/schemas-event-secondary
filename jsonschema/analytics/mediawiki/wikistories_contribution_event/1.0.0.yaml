      The type of event that occured:

      * story_builder_open: The user opens the story editing interface.

      * add_frame: The user adds a new frame to the story. Currently, this
      happens when the user adds an image to the story, which becomes a new
      frame. Multiple images can be added at once, but this should only result
      in a single event.

      * remove_frame: The user deletes a frame from the story.

      * replace_image: The user replaces an image already used in the story.

      * import_text: The user imports text from an article into a frame.

      * edit_text: The user edits the text in a frame. Logged when the user
      leaves a text box having made/saved a change.

      * publish_failure: The user's publish attempt fails due to an invalid
      title, AbuseFilter or other publication limit.

      * publish_success: The user's publish attempt succeeds and the story is
      published.
