      The type of event that occurred:

      * story_impression: A story becomes visible to the user for the first time
      during a page view. If multiple adjacent stories are visible, each one
      results in a simultaneous impression event. Any stories that have
      overflowed produce impressions only when scrolled into view.

      * story_view: The user finishes viewing a story, whether they viewed it to
      the end or closed it early.

      * experiment_pageview: A consumer enrolled in a Wikistories experiment
      finishes viewing any page on the wiki. This should be sent whenever the
      page is closed or hidden, which may result in duplicate events.
