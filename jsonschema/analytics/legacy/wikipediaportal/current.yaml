  Logs basic information about the use of the Wikipedia

  portal (www.wikipedia.org). Most of the things we want (user agent, say) are
  already tracked. It is important to note that the sessions can last an
  arbitrary length of time as session ID is set to expire 15 minutes after the
  initial landing, with the expiration timer resetting every time the user comes
  back to the page within the 15 minute timer. This means that we can (and do)
  have sessions that last for hours with thousands of events logged to them.

            description: >-
              A unique session ID that identifies events from a single user,
              resetting on every portal view. In other words, both 'landing' and
              'clickthrough' events from a single user in a single session can
              be clumped together.

              The type of event we're logging. Options are 'landing' - the start
              event, when someone shows up on a portal; 'clickthrough',
              indicating that they chose a link or the search bar or whatever
              and went somewhere else; and 'select-language', which means the
              user has selected a different language to search in
          section_used:
            type: string
            enum:
              - primary links
              - search

              The overall section interacted with. This could be
               'primary links' (the called-out project links around the globe',
              'search' (the main search box), 'language search' (' Find
              Wikipedia in a language'),
               'secondary links' (the less-prominent plaintext links)
               'other languages' (this page in other langauges)
               or 'other projects' (links to wikisource, wiktionary, et al, portals).

            type: string
          cohort:
            description: >-
              A cohort identifier. We can use this for running A/B tests or
              unrelated experiments, with the population who are *not* in any
              tests getting a NULL cohort field, meaning we can base our
              dashboards off those users and A/B test from the same schema in
              peace.
            type: string
          selected_language:
            description: >-
              The language that the user has selected to search in. In most
              cases, we expect this to be the same as the first language in
              'accept_language' since that is selected automatically. When the
              user searches ('event_type' is 'clickthrough' and 'section_used'
              is 'search'), this field contains the language the user searched
              in, in case they went to a SERP rather than a specific article.
