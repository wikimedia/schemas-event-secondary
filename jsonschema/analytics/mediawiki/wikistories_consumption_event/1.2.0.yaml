  activity_session_id:
    description: >
      The standard unique ID for the current activity session, which expires
      after 30 minutes of inactivity.

      The activity session was defined for the session_tick instrumention and
      its ID can be retrieved using `mw.eventLog.id.getSessionId`. It should not
      be confused with the standard MediaWiki session ID, which persists in a
      session cookie and can be retrieved using `mw.user.sessionId`.

  event_type:
    description: >
      The type of event that occurred:

      * story_impression: The user loaded a page with one or more attached
      stories.

      * story_view: The user finished viewing a story, whether they viewed it to
      the end or closed it early.

      * experiment_pageview: For users enrolled in a Wikistories consumption
      experiment, the user finished viewing any page on the wiki. This is sent
      whenever the page is closed or hidden, which will sometimes result in
      multiple events for the same page view. These can be deduplicated by using
      only the latest experiment_pageview event for each pageview ID.

      * story_share: The user accesses one of the share links from the
      editor(story builder) view.
