description: >
  Tracks events related to use of Extension:ContentTranslation, which is maintained by the
  Wikimedia Foundation's Language Engineering team. Some tracked events are user-initiated
  (like opening the dashboard and starting a new translation), while others are system-intitiated
  (like warning the user about using too much unmodified machine translation).

  For further details, see the readme in the schema repository.

        description: >
          The database code for the wiki which the user is currently interacting with (and which is
          shown in the current URL). This is less meaningful than usual because Content Translation
          presents a single, cross-wiki interface to the user.

        description: >
          The type of client that the user is using.

          Normally, this field also accepts the value "mobile app", but no mobile app client
          supports Content Translation. For historical reasons, the values use spaces rather than
          underscores.

      translation_type:
        description: >
          The type of translation or suggestion the user is interacting with. Applies only to
          events which relate to a specific translation or suggestion, including all `editor_` and
          `publish_` events and some `dashboard_` events (e.g. `dashboard_start_translation`,
          `dashboard_delete_translation`).

          `lead_section` means a translation of the first section of an article, which will result
          in the creation of a new page except in the unusual case that the user has chosen to
          translate a section that already exists (i.e. where translation_target_exists).
        type: string
        enum:

        description: >
          The ID used in the cx_translation MediaWiki table for the translation the user is
          currently interacting with. Omitted if it has not yet been generated or does not exist
          (as with section translations). Applies only to events which relate to a specific
          translation, including all `editor_` and `publish_` events and some `dashboard_` events
          (e.g. `dashboard_continue_translation`, `dashboard_delete_translation`).
        type: integer

      translation_source_language:
        description: >
          The ISO 639 code for the source language of the current translation or, when on the
          dashboard, of the suggestions.
        type: string

      translation_source_title:
        description: >
          The title of the source article of the current translation. Applies only to events which
          relate to a specific translation or suggestion: all `editor_` and `publish_` events and
          some `dashboard_` events (e.g. `dashboard_start_translation`,
          `dashboard_delete_translation`)
        type: string

      translation_source_section:
        description: >
          The title of the source section of the current translation, if it is a section
          translation. Applies only to events which relate to a specific translation or suggestion:
          all `editor_` and `publish_` events and some `dashboard_` events (e.g.
          `dashboard_start_translation`, `dashboard_delete_translation`).
        type: string

      translation_target_language:
        description: >
          The ISO 639 code for the target language of the the current translation or, when on the
          dashboard, of the suggestions.
        type: string

      translation_target_title:
        description: >
          The title of the page in which the current translation has been or will be published.
          Applies only to events which relate to a specific translation: all `editor_` and
          `publish_` events and some `dashboard_` events (e.g. `dashboard_continue_translation`,
          `dashboard_delete_translation`). Omitted if the user has not yet translated the title.
        type: string

      translation_target_section:
        description: >
          The title of the section in which the current translation has been or will be published,
          if it is a section translation. Applies only to events which relate to a specific
          translation or suggestion: all `editor_` and `publish_` events and some `dashboard_`
          events (e.g. `dashboard_start_translation`, `dashboard_delete_translation`). Omitted if
          the user has not yet translated the section title.
        type: string

      translation_target_exists:
        description: >
          Whether the target article or section already exists. Applies only to events which relate
          to a specific translation or suggestion: all `editor_` and `publish_` events and some
          `dashboard_` events (e.g. `dashboard_start_translation`, `dashboard_delete_translation`).
          In section translation, if the user discards the mapping to an existing target section,
          the value should change to false in future events.
        type: boolean

      translation_provider:
        description: >
          The translation engine that is supplying the base text for new segments when the event
          occurs. When the editor is first opened, this will be the language default, but can
          change if the user chooses a different provider for a particular chunk or sets a new
          default.

          `blank` and `source` are not real translation engines; `blank` means the user is starting
          with a blank segment and `source` means the user is starting with the untranslated source
          text.

          Applies only to `editor_` and `publish_` events.
        type: string
        enum:
          - apertium
          - blank
          - google
          - lingocloud
          - matxin

      human_modification_rate:
        description: >
          The proportion of the document or segment which has been manually changed by the user
          from the output of the translation provider.

          Applies to `publish_` events (where it is the proportion of the whole translation) and to
          `editor_segment_edit` (where it is the proportion of the edited segment).
        type: number
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 1

      human_modification_threshold:
        description: >
          The lowest whole-translation human modification rate where the user will be allowed to
          publish the translation. Different thresholds are configured at different wikis. Applies
          only to `publish_` events.
        type: number
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 1

      published_page_id:
        description: >
          The MediaWiki ID of the page where the published text has been added. Applies only to
          `publish_success` events.
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxiumum: 9007199254740991

      published_revision_id:
        description: >
          The MediaWiki ID of the revision where the published text has been added. This is
          necessary since multiple section translations can be made to the same page. Applies only
          to `publish_success` events.
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxiumum: 9007199254740991

      user_name:

          The name of the user's account. Not applicable to anonymous users.
        type: string

      user_is_anonymous:
        description: >
          Whether the user is an anonymous (unregistered) user.
        type: boolean

      user_global_edit_count:
        description: >
          The user’s edit count across all Wikimedia wikis, available from CentralAuth. Not applicable to anonymous users.

          In the context of Content Translation, the global edit count is much more useful than a
          single local edit count, since the user will have different edit counts at the source
          and target wikis.
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 9007199254740991

      user_global_edit_count_bucket:
        description: >
          A bucketed version of `user_global_edit_count`. Unlike that field, this one can be
          retained in the sanitized version, since it provides less information that could be used
          to reidentify the user. Not applicable to anonymous users.

          The values are the ones returned by EventLogging's `getUserEditCountBucket` function,
          which can be used to populate this field.
        type: string
        enum:
          - '0 edits'
          - '1-4 edits'
          - '5-99 edits'
          - '100-999 edits'
          - '1000+ edits'

      utm_source:
        description: >
          The value of the URL's `utm_source` query parameter, used to identify the site or
          product that is the source of the traffic (e.g. Wikipedia GapFinder or Facebook).
        type: string

      utm_campaign:
        description: >
          The value of the URL's `utm_campaign` query parameter, used to identify the campaign
          responsible for the traffic (e.g. Wikipedia Asian Month 2020).

          If present, the `campaign` query parameter should also be placed in this field for
          compatibility with preexisting URLs.
