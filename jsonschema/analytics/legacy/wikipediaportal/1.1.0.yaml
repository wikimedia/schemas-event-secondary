  Logs basic information about the use of the Wikipedia

  portal (www.wikipedia.org). Most of the things we want (user agent, say) are
  already tracked. It is important to note that the sessions can last an
  arbitrary length of time as session ID is set to expire 15 minutes after the
  initial landing, with the expiration timer resetting every time the user comes
  back to the page within the 15 minute timer. This means that we can (and do)
  have sessions that last for hours with thousands of events logged to them.

      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:

          A cohort identifier. We can use this for running A/B tests or
          unrelated experiments, with the population who are *not* in any tests
          getting a NULL cohort field, meaning we can base our dashboards off
          those users and A/B test from the same schema in peace.

          The type of event we're logging. Options are 'landing' - the start
          event, when someone shows up on a portal; 'clickthrough', indicating
          that they chose a link or the search bar or whatever and went
          somewhere else; and 'select-language', which means the user has
          selected a different language to search in

          'search' (the main search box), 'language search' (' Find Wikipedia in
          a language'),
           'secondary links' (the less-prominent plaintext links)
           'other languages' (this page in other langauges)
           or 'other projects' (links to wikisource, wiktionary, et al, portals).

      selected_language:
        description: >-
          The language that the user has selected to search in. In most cases,
          we expect this to be the same as the first language in
          'accept_language' since that is selected automatically. When the user
          searches ('event_type' is 'clickthrough' and 'section_used' is
          'search'), this field contains the language the user searched in, in
          case they went to a SERP rather than a specific article.

      session_id:

          A unique session ID that identifies events from a single user,

          'clickthrough' events from a single user in a single session can be
          clumped together.
