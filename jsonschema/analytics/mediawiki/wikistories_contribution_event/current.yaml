        A step in the creation or editing of story content using
        Extension:Wikistories. In this context, a "story" is a slideshow of
        images with superimposed text; a "frame" is one of the individual
        slides.

        This schema is designed for the main "story builder" interface and is
        not intended to be used for the secondary "edit form" interface for
        stories (accessed at URLs like
        /w/index.php?title=Story:Title&action=edit, compared to URLs like
        /wiki/Special:StoryBuilder/Article for the story builder).

            The type of event that occured:

            * story_builder_open: The user opened the story editing interface.

            * add_frame: The user added a new frame to the story. Currently,
            this happens when the user adds an image to the story, which becomes
            a new frame. Multiple images can be added at once, but this should
            only result in a single event.

            * remove_frame: The user deleted a frame from the story.

            * replace_image: The user replaced an image already used in the
            story.

            * import_text: The user imported text from an article into a frame.

            * edit_text: The user edited the text in a frame. Specificially, the
            user's focus left a text box after they made some change to the
            text.

            * publish_failure: The user's publish attempt failed due to an
            invalid title, AbuseFilter, or other publication limit.

            * publish_success: The user's publish attempt succeeded and the
            story was published.

            As of Oct 2022, only story_builder_open, publish_failure, and
            publish_success have been implemented.
