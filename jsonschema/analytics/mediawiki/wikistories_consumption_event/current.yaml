            The type of event that occurred:

            * story_impression: The user loaded a page with one or more attached
            stories.

            * story_view: The user finished viewing a story, whether they viewed
            it to the end or closed it early.

            * experiment_pageview: For users enrolled in a Wikistories
            consumption experiment, the user finished viewing any page on the
            wiki. This is sent whenever the page is closed or hidden, which will
            sometimes result in multiple events for the same page view. These
            can be deduplicated by using only the latest experiment_pageview
            event for each pageview ID.

            * story_share: The user accesses one of the share links from the editor(story builder) view.


            As of Oct 2022, experiment_pageview is not implemented.

            and its ID can be retrieved using `mw.eventLog.id.getSessionId`. It
            should not be confused with the standard MediaWiki session ID, which
            persists in a session cookie and can be retrieved using
            `mw.user.sessionId`.
