description: >
  A step in the creation or editing of story content using
  Extension:Wikistories. In this context, a "story" is a slideshow of images
  with superimposed text; a "frame" is one of the individual slides.

  This schema is designed for the main "story builder" interface and is not
  intended to be used for the secondary "edit form" interface for stories
  (accessed at URLs like /w/index.php?title=Story:Title&action=edit, compared to
  URLs like /wiki/Special:StoryBuilder/Article for the story builder).

  context_page_title:

      builder. Null if the user accessed the story builder directly, without

    type: string
  contribution_attempt_id:

  event_type:
    description: >
      The type of event that occured:

      * story_builder_open: The user opened the story editing interface.

      * add_frame: The user added a new frame to the story. Currently, this
      happens when the user adds an image to the story, which becomes a new
      frame. Multiple images can be added at once, but this should only result
      in a single event.

      * remove_frame: The user deleted a frame from the story.

      * replace_image: The user replaced an image already used in the story.

      * import_text: The user imported text from an article into a frame.

      * edit_text: The user edited the text in a frame. Specificially, the
      user's focus left a text box after they made some change to the text.

      * publish_failure: The user's publish attempt failed due to an invalid
      title, AbuseFilter, or other publication limit.

      * publish_success: The user's publish attempt succeeded and the story was
      published.

      As of Oct 2022, only story_builder_open, publish_failure, and
      publish_success have been implemented.
