      system blocks, it's a keyword describing the type of block. For composite
      blocks, it's an array of the identifiers of each composing block. See

      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:
