  dt:

      ISO-8601 formatted timestamp of when the event occurred/was generated in
      UTC). This exists separately from meta.dt in the main common schema. For
      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:
