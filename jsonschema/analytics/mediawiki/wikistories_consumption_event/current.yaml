            The type of event that occurred:

            * story_impression: A story becomes visible to the user for the first time during a page
            view. If multiple adjacent stories are visible, each one results in a simultaneous
            impression event. Any stories that have overflowed produce impressions only when
            scrolled into view.

            * story_view: The user finishes viewing a story, whether they viewed it to the end or
            closed it early.
        
            * experiment_pageview: A consumer enrolled in a Wikistories experiment finishes viewing
            any page on the wiki. This should be sent whenever the page is closed or hidden, which
            may result in duplicate events.
