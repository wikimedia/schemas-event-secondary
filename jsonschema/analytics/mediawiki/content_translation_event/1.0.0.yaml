description: >
  Tracks events related to use of Extension:ContentTranslation, which is
  maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation's Language Engineering team. Some
  tracked events are user-initiated (like opening the dashboard and starting a
  new translation), while others are system-intitiated (like warning the user
  about using too much unmodified machine translation).

  For further details, see the readme in the schema repository.

      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.

    pattern: '^[0-9a-z]{20}$'
    description: >
      Identifies a web session: a cluster of actions taken by the user on a
      website within a limited period of time. A session ID is generated the
      first time it is requested by the instrumentation code, which is usually
      the first time the user visits the website.

      In the current implementation, this ID is shared across windows, tabs, and
      page views in the same browser. The ID is normally regenerated after the
      browser is shut down; however, if the browser's "restore previous session"
      feature is used when it restarts, the previous ID is retained.

      Interactions across multiple pages in the same web session may be linked
      together via this identifier.

      Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.sessionId()

    pattern: '^[0-9a-z]{20}$'
    description: >
      Identifies a single web page view (visit). This identifier is randomly
      generated the first time it is requested by the instrumentation code on
      any page view and persists for the lifetime of the page. When the user
      navigates to another page or refreshes/reloads the page, this identifier
      disappears and a new one is regenerated (when needed). Different visits to
      the same page will yield different pageview IDs (also called tokens).

      Interactions with multiple features (instrumented separately) on the same
      web page may be linked together via this identifier.

      Instrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.getPageviewToken()
  wiki_db:
    description: >
      The database code for the wiki which the user is currently interacting

      to the user.

  access_method:

      The type of client that the user is using.

      Normally, this field also accepts the value "mobile app", but no mobile

      `lead_section` means a translation of the first section of an article,

      and `publish_` events and some `dashboard_` events (e.g.
      `dashboard_start_translation`, `dashboard_delete_translation`). In section
      translation, if the user discards the mapping to an existing target
      section, the value should change to false in future events.
    type: boolean
  translation_provider:
    description: >
      The translation engine that is supplying the base text for new segments
      when the event occurs. When the editor is first opened, this will be the
      language default, but can change if the user chooses a different provider
      for a particular chunk or sets a new default.

      `blank` and `source` are not real translation engines; `blank` means the
      user is starting with a blank segment and `source` means the user is
      starting with the untranslated source text.

      Applies only to `editor_` and `publish_` events.

      The proportion of the document or segment which has been manually changed
      by the user from the output of the translation provider.

      Applies to `publish_` events (where it is the proportion of the whole

  user_global_edit_count:
    description: >
      The user’s edit count across all Wikimedia wikis, available from
      CentralAuth. Not applicable to anonymous users.

      In the context of Content Translation, the global edit count is much more
      useful than a single local edit count, since the user will have different
      edit counts at the source and target wikis.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 9007199254740991
  user_global_edit_count_bucket:
    description: >
      A bucketed version of `user_global_edit_count`. Unlike that field, this
      one can be retained in the sanitized version, since it provides less
      information that could be used to reidentify the user. Not applicable to
      anonymous users.

      The values are the ones returned by EventLogging's
      `getUserEditCountBucket` function, which can be used to populate this
      field.

  utm_source:
    description: >
      The value of the URL's `utm_source` query parameter, used to identify the
      site or product that is the source of the traffic (e.g. Wikipedia
      GapFinder or Facebook).
    type: string
  utm_campaign:
    description: >
      The value of the URL's `utm_campaign` query parameter, used to identify
      the campaign responsible for the traffic (e.g. Wikipedia Asian Month
      2020).

      If present, the `campaign` query parameter should also be placed in this
      field for compatibility with preexisting URLs.
